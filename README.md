# CIFAR10 Classifier

This project has the purpuse of showing how to train a CNN using PyTorch, saving a training routine that can be extended for future applications and to provide a way to check if PyTorch is able to use de GPUs correctly. With this goal in mind, we try to solve the problem of image classification in the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images classified within 10 classes. The clases represent objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, etc.

We present two experiments:

* Custom Model:
* Pretrained Model:
